# Civilization Game
A replication of the famous Civilization game using Java and JavaFx. I did not develop the game
from scratch by myself. Part of the game was provided to me by a class that I was taking. I wrote the majority of the code and all the graphics. I do not own any of the sounds and images in the game. They all came from free websites. The project was done for educational purposes only.

To compile the game, execute the command in the command line:
javac -cp src/main/java src/main/java/runner/*.java src/main/java/model/*.java src/main/java/view/*.java src/main/java/controller/*.java

To run the game, execute the command in the command line:
java -cp src/main/java runner.CivilizationGame
